                      The Office is primarily responsible for providing
                      direction, assistance and synchronizing all of the
                      University’s international work with overseas Institutions
                      and Governments. While providing this leadership role, the
                      office does recognize the importance of individual
                      initiatives, needs and innovativeness of faculty and
                      students across the University. Thus, its primary role is
                      to coordinate the individual activities through a central
                      location, within the context of a well thought out
                      international strategic plan and to facilitate the
                      interrelated and concomitant activities. The key focus is
                      to provide a centralized location for helping the faculty,
                      staff and students the needed assistance for all of their
                      international work. Individual decentralized colleges and
                      schools will still continue to pursue their individual
                      interests although they will be required to coordinate
                      their work through this central location.

                    <p>
                      The office will also help align international
                      opportunities with each college’s curriculum enabling
                      student mobility across institutions, enroll transnational
                      students for both short and long term, facilitate
                      institutional grants and contracts, and pursue value
                      creating projects for the University in general.

                      It is not uncommon these days for students to traverse the
                      globe to spend a few weeks or a semester engaging
                      themselves in studying, co-opting or interning, conducting
                      research or partaking in other academic pursuits, in
                      countries around the world. These experiences advance and
                      impact positively their attitudes, skill sets and
                      knowledge base, which will be of immense benefit to the
                      students and enable to be competitive and resourceful in
                      the future. Thus, DoIC will be the University's
                      comprehensive resource for study abroad, research abroad,
                      intern abroad, and other educational experiences
                      worldwide. The pivotal goal is to help students and
                      faculty stretch across borders, perhaps farther than they
                      thought possible. By promoting intercultural competence,
                      meticulous erudition and acquisition of foreign languages,
                      DoIC should provide opportunities for academically sound
                      international experiences. It will also administer student
                      exchange programs with partner institutions around the
                      globe, in conjunction with other bodies on campus.
